/*My grandfather always predicted how old people would get, and right before he passed away he revealed his secret!

In honor of my grandfather's memory we will write a function using his formula!

    Take a list of ages when each of your great-grandparent died.
    Multiply each number by itself.
    Add them all together.
    Take the square root of the result.
    Divide by two.

Example

predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) === 86
*/

function predictAge(...age){
return  Math.floor(Math.sqrt(age.reduce((a,b) => a+(b*b),0))/2)
}
